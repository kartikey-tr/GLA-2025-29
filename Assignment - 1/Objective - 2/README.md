# Objective - 1

This folder is for my **Objective 2** of the assignment.  
It includes my own header file and source file where I’ve written the function logic, and a main file to test them both.

## Files Included
- **arraylib.h** — header file where I’ve declared the functions  
- **arraylib.c** — source file where I’ve written the actual function logic  
- **main.c** — used to test the functions from mylib  
- **README.md** — this file you’re reading

## How to Compile and Run
If you want to compile and run this code, open terminal inside this folder and type:

```bash
gcc main.c arraylib.c -o main.exe
main.exe
```

## What It Does

When you run the program, it’ll call the functions from arraylib.c (through array.h) and show their results.
